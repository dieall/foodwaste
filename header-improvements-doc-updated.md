## Installation and Usage

### Including the Files

1. CSS file: Include the header CSS file in the `layouts/admin/partials/css.blade.php`:
```blade
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ asset('assets/css/header-improvements.css') }}">
```

2. JavaScript files: Include the JavaScript files in `layouts/admin/partials/js.blade.php`:
```blade
<script src="{{ asset('assets/js/notification-api.js') }}"></script>
<script src="{{ asset('assets/js/virtual-notification-list.js') }}"></script>
<script src="{{ asset('assets/js/realtime-notifications.js') }}"></script>
<script src="{{ asset('assets/js/browser-compatibility.js') }}"></script>
<script src="{{ asset('assets/js/header-improvements.js') }}"></script>
```

### Using Dark Mode

The dark mode toggle can be used by clicking on the moon icon in the header. The setting will be persisted across page loads using localStorage.

### Testing Mobile Responsiveness

The header has been optimized for the following breakpoints:
- Desktop: > 991px
- Tablet: 575px - 991px
- Mobile: < 575px
- Extra small: < 360px

### Running Compatibility Tests

You can run the browser compatibility test by adding `?check_compatibility=true` to any URL in the application. This will show a floating panel with compatibility information.

### Running API Integration Tests

You can run the notification API integration tests by adding `?run_api_tests=true` to any URL. The test results will be shown in the browser console.

### Accessibility Features

- All interactive elements have focus styles
- Icon-only buttons have screen reader text
- Proper ARIA attributes for menus and buttons
- Keyboard navigation support for all features
- Support for prefers-reduced-motion
- Color contrast meeting WCAG AA standards

### Color Variables

The following CSS variables are available for customization:
```css
--nfw-primary: #2C6B2F;  /* Primary green */
--nfw-light: #FAF3E0;    /* Light text color */
--nfw-dark: #1a1a1a;     /* Dark text color */
--nfw-accent: #FF7F50;   /* Accent color */

## Developer Notes

2. `public/assets/css/header-improvements.css` - CSS file
3. `public/assets/js/header-improvements.js` - Main JavaScript file

### Key Files Added
1. `public/assets/js/virtual-notification-list.js` - Virtual scrolling for large lists
2. `public/assets/js/realtime-notifications.js` - WebSocket-based notifications
3. `public/assets/js/browser-compatibility.js` - Browser compatibility testing
4. `public/assets/js/notification-api-tests.js` - Integration tests
5. `header-improvements-doc.md` - Documentation

### Real-time Notifications

The real-time notification system uses WebSockets to receive updates without polling the server. To use it:

1. Make sure the WebSocket server is running
2. Add a `<meta name="user-id" content="{{ Auth::id() }}">` tag to your layout
3. The system will automatically connect and listen for notifications

Features:
- Background notifications when the browser tab isn't active
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Desktop notifications (with user permission)
- Notification sound support
- Mark as read synchronization

### Virtual Scrolling

For large notification lists (more than 10 items), the system will automatically use virtual scrolling for better performance. This:
- Renders only visible items plus a buffer
- Reduces memory usage and DOM size
- Improves scrolling performance
- Maintains all functionality like marking items as read

### Browser Compatibility

The browser compatibility checker tests support for:
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- CSS variables
- localStorage
- Fetch API
- Promises
- CSS transitions
- Touch events
- WebP images
- WebSockets
- Intersection Observer
- Media queries
- prefers-reduced-motion
- prefers-color-scheme
