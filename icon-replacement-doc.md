# Icon Replacement Documentation

## Background
The leaderboard page in the No Food Waste application had issues with certain Font Awesome icons not displaying properly. This is because the project is using Font Awesome 4.7.0, but some icons in the template were from Font Awesome 5 or newer versions.

## Changes Made
We've replaced all Font Awesome 5+ icons with compatible Font Awesome 4.7.0 icons:

| Original FA5+ Icon | Replaced with FA4.7 Icon |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| fa-calendar-alt    | fa-calendar              |
| fa-user-friends    | fa-users                 |
| fa-crown           | fa-star                  |
| fa-sync-alt        | fa-refresh               |
| fa-hands-helping   | fa-handshake-o           |
| fa-user-tag        | fa-user                  |
| fa-weight          | fa-balance-scale         |
| fa-box-open        | fa-archive               |
| fa-lightbulb       | fa-lightbulb-o           |
| fa-clock           | fa-clock-o               |
| fab fa-facebook-f  | fa fa-facebook           |
| fab fa-twitter     | fa fa-twitter            |
| fab fa-whatsapp    | fa fa-whatsapp           |

## Files Modified
1. resources/views/leaderboard/index.blade.php - The main view file for the leaderboard
2. public/assets/js/leaderboard.js - JavaScript functionality for the leaderboard

## Additional Resources
We've also created an icon replacement mapping file for future reference:
- public/assets/js/icon-replacements.js

## Note
While we focused on fixing the icons in the leaderboard view, there are other pages in the application that may still be using Font Awesome 5+ icons. These include:
- welcome.blade.php
- login.blade.php
- register.blade.php

These pages should be reviewed separately to ensure all icons are displaying properly.
