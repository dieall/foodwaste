# CSS Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This documentation explains the refactoring of CSS styles in the NoFoodWaste leaderboard page. We've separated the inline styles from the Blade template file into an external CSS file to improve code organization, maintainability, and performance.

## Changes Made

1. **Created External CSS File**:
   - Created a new file: `public/assets/css/leaderboard.css`
   - Moved all styles from `resources/views/leaderboard/index.blade.php` to this new file

2. **Modified Blade Template**:
   - Removed the inline `<style>` section from the Blade file
   - Added a link to the new external CSS file:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('assets/css/leaderboard.css') }}">
     ```

3. **Removed Inline JavaScript Styles**:
   - Removed the dynamically added styles from leaderboard.js
   - Moved the animation styles to the CSS file

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**:
   - HTML (Blade templates) now focuses on structure
   - CSS (external file) handles styling
   - JavaScript handles behavior

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Browser can now cache the CSS file
   - Reduced the size of the HTML document
   - Faster page loading times

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Styles are now centralized in one file
   - Easier to find and update styles
   - Better organization of code

4. **Reusability**:
   - The styles can be reused across multiple pages if needed

## Files Modified

- `resources/views/leaderboard/index.blade.php`
- `public/assets/js/leaderboard.js`

## Files Created

- `public/assets/css/leaderboard.css`

## How to Test

1. Visit the leaderboard page at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/leaderboard`
2. Verify that all styles are applied correctly
3. Check that all interactive elements (buttons, tabs, etc.) function properly
4. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window
